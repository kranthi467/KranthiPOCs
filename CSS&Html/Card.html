                    Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group
                    of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and coherence
                    of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph.
